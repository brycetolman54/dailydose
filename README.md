# Startup specifications:
## The Idea
I am going to create a social media site called ***DailyDose***. The purpose of this social media page will be to share uplifiting stories, quotes, and thoughts about the scriptures and the Gospel of Jesus Christ. This is to pursue the call of the General Authorities of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to share the Gospel using social media. ***DailyDose*** will be a site that people can visit to feel hope in their daily life and to remove themselves from the negative environments that plague other social media sites.

***DailyDose*** users will be able to do the following things on the site:
  1. _Post_ thoughts, insights, and stories to uplift others
  2. _Comment_ and _Like_ others' posts
  3. _View_ a daily quote from inspirational leaders and thinkers
  4. _Chat_ with other users about Gospel topics
 
## The Technologies
  Here is how I am going to use each of the technologies in 
   1. **Authentication:** Each memeber will have to login to their account in order to post, comment, like, or chat.
   2. **Database data:** The database will store the posts and chats of each of the users of the site.
   3. **WebSocket Data:** The site will pull inspirational quotes from other websites. Also, users will be able to communicate with eachother on the site.

## The Vision
**Here is how I envision the website:**

# HTML Deliverable
In this deliverable, I put in place the structure of my website.
- ***HTML Pages:*** I added 4 HTML pages to the website
  - _Main_ page
  - _Feed_ page
  - _Chat_ page
  - _My Posts_ page
- ***Links:*** The _Main_ page automatically links to the _Feed_ page when a user logs in. Each page has links to all of the pages at the top.
- ***Text:*** The posts in the _My Posts_ page are represented by text. The chat in the _Chat_ page is represented by text. The posts in the _Feed_ are represented by text.
- ***Application Images:*** Each page has an image at the top of it, the logo or icon for the page.
- ***Login:*** The _Main_ page has a Username and Password field, along with a submit button, for a user to login to their account on the site.
- ***Database:*** The posts on the _My Posts_ page represent the data stored in and pulled from the database.
-  ***WebSocket:*** The _Chat_ page and the inspirational quote on the _Feed_ page show realtime data and data being pulled from another server.

# CSS Deliverable
- ***Header, Footer, and Main Content Body:*** I added styling for each part of each of my HTML pages.
- ***Navigation Elements:*** I put the navigation elements in a box, spaced evenly and separated by lines. I made the links light up when they are hovered over.
- ***Responsive to window resizing:*** I make the header and footer disappear if the screen gets too small. I make the inspirational quote move to the top of the feed page if the window gets too small. 
- ***Application elements:***
- ***Application text content:***
- ***Application Iamges:*** I made the image I had on my site into the background image for the top of my site.
