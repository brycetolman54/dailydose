# Startup specifications:
## The Idea
I am going to create a social media site called ***DailyDose***. The purpose of this social media page will be to share uplifiting stories, quotes, and thoughts about the scriptures and the Gospel of Jesus Christ. This is to pursue the call of the General Authorities of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to share the Gospel using social media. ***DailyDose*** will be a site that people can visit to feel hope in their daily life and to remove themselves from the negative environments that plague other social media sites.

***DailyDose*** users will be able to do the following things on the site:
  1. _Post_ thoughts, insights, and stories to uplift others
  2. _Comment_ and _Like_ others' posts
  3. _View_ a daily quote from inspirational leaders and thinkers
  4. _Chat_ with other users about Gospel topics
 
## The Technologies
  Here is how I am going to use each of the technologies in 
   1. **Authentication:** Each memeber will have to login to their account in order to post, comment, like, or chat.
   2. **Database data:** The database will store the posts and chats of each of the users of the site.
   3. **WebSocket Data:** The site will pull inspirational quotes from other websites. Also, users will be able to communicate with eachother on the site.

## The Vision
**Here is how I envision the website:**
