hello world

- You can make a git file to keep track of changes with git init
- You can add files with git add .
- You can look at the git with git status
- You can commit changes with git commit
- If you add -m "comment" that will add a comment to you git
- If you have already added a file and want to commit it, just do -am instead of -m
- You can use git log to look at past commits
- You can switch to a different commit by using git checkout ### where the ### is the number at the top of the commit shown in the log
- You can go back to the right file by git checkout master
- You can use diff to compare two commits, just do git diff HEAD HEAD~#, where # is the distance from the head of the file you are interested in

- We are testing things here

- We can branch with git branch A to see if we like how something would go
- We can switch back and forth with checkout between the master and the branches
- We can combine the two with git merge branchname if we want

- We can pull from a changed repository with git pull
- We can see the changes that have been made before pulling with git fetch then git status
- We can use git push to push our changes to the repository
- We can use git clone URL to make the repository appear here

goodbye world
