# My Notes: These are for Markdown

- You can create a link by the following method:
	Link for my Read Me [README](README.md)

- You can use "#" for first level heading, "##" for second level, and "###" for third
- Bold can be accomplished with **Bold I am**
- Italics can be accomplished by *Here it is*
- Strikethrough with ~~Like this~~
- Bold with nested italics is **Oh me _oh_ my** with the _ _ for the italics
- ***Me oh my*** for all italics and bold
- <sub>down here</sub> for subscript
- <sup>up here</sup> for superscript
- You just use > to quote text
- You can quote `code` like this
- Or multiline like:
```
this
this 
and this
```
- You can use Hex color model: `#RRGGBB`
- Or the RGB: `rgb(R,G,B)`
- Or the HSL: `hsl(H,S,L)`

- You can also make lists: 
  - unordered with "-,*, or +"
  - ordered with numbers
    1. Hey
    2. There
    3. Friend
- You can mark lists with
 - [ ] Do this
 - [ ] Then this
 - [x] This is done
	\(escape parentheses asi)

- You can also[^1] add footnotes[^2] like this

[^1]:Here I am
[^2]: Me too

<!-- this content is a comment -->

- Just use \\ to escape things

- Here is how to make a table:

| thing	| other thing |
| :--- | :---: |
| 'here'  | now me      |
| 'more'  | a bit more that allows me to make the box big |
- You just need 3 --- to make a column, use pipes to separate, use : on the left, right, or both sides of the --- to justify it
