# HTML
- You want to label your main, head file for html "index.html"
- You need to have `<!DOCTYPE html>` for the document to be seen as an html doc
- You need to have an opening and closing tag for each element (pretty much)
- `<html lang="en">`, this is `<opentag attribute=value>`
- The attributes can be in _any order_ you want
- You don't have to have an end tag if there are no children in the tag
  - You would write this as `<html lang="en"/>`
- You can write comments: `<!-- Here is a comment -->`
  - These can be multiline too, just put the `-->` at the end of the lines
- The escape character for html is &
- The **Document Object Model** (DOM) is the memory of the tree that represents our document
- Here is a tag for an image: `<img alt="beach" src="https://images.pexels.jpg" />`
  - src: This tells you the link to get the image
  - alt: This is what is read if somebody can't see the image
  - width: This modifies the width, it auto adjusts the height as well if you don't 
  - height: This adjusts the height
  - The reference can be absolute (the full URL) or it can be relative (able to access by a path, close in directory)
