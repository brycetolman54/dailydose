# HTML
- You want to label your main, head file for html "index.html"
- You need to have '\<!DOCTYPE html\>' for the document to be seen as an html doc
- You need to have an opening and closing tag for each element (pretty much)
- '\<html lang="en"\>', this is '\<opentag attribute=value\>'
- You don't have to have an end tag if there are no children in the tag
  - You would write this as '\<html lang="en"/\>'
