Internet Protocol (IP): 
- It is a packet of data
- This defines what a packet looks like and what an address looks like
	
Web server:
- This is the site
- It has an address
- It is on a port (80 is used for http sites)
	
From our browser:
- We want to get to a site
- We know the address of the site we want to get to
- We interact with the IP (it's like the mail delivery system) and it connects to routers in the cloud
- We connect to the destination
	
Transmission Control protocol (TCP):
- This is included in the IP when we send out for our destination address
- This is to get reliable transmission
- There is a port as well that is part of the TCP, each program kind of uses a different port
	
UDP:
- This is an unreliable protocol, if it can't get there fast, it just doesn't
- This is for things like video games or video calls
	
Port: 
- There are 16 bits for this
	
Domain name service (DNS):
- Connects to other DNS servers around the world
- These are things like .com, .edu, etc.
- He goes and grabs the IP address for the domain name that you put in your browser
- If you have a site like mfc.byu.edu, you go to the .edu server first, then the .byu.edu server, then you get the mfc IP address
